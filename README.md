# OpenCV in macOS GUI Apps
I had been looking for sample codes of OpenCV used in GUI apps of macOS (not for iOS or iPadOS, etc).
But I couldn't.
I made a simple sample app of macOS using OpenCV library. I also built ‘opencv2.framework’ of version 4.2.0, and used it in this Xcode project.

OpenCV site : https://opencv.org/<br>
Source of the framework : https://opencv.org/opencv-4-2-0/
