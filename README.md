# OpenCV in macOS GUI Apps
I had been looking for sample codes of OpenCV used in GUI apps of macOS (not for iOS or iPadOS, etc).
But I couldn't.
I made a simple sample app of macOS using OpenCV library. ‘opencv2.framework’ of version 4.2.0 was built, and used in this Xcode project.

OpenCV site : https://opencv.org/
Source of the framework : https://opencv.org/opencv-4-2-0/
